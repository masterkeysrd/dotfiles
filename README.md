# Dot Files

This repository contains my dot files, which are used to configure my computer
in a way that I like. The files are organized in a way that makes it easy to
install them on a new machine.

## Installation

To install the dot files, run the following commands:

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/masterkeysrd/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/install.sh | bash
# or
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/masterkeysrd/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/install.sh | bash
```
